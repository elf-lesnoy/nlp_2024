# NLP Course 2024

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course**. This repository contains all the materials for each week, including lecture notes, notebooks, and additional resources.

## Course Overview

This course covers modern NLP topics, including text classification, language models, transformers, fine-tuning, and more. Below is the weekly breakdown:

### Weeks:
1. **Introduction to NLP**  
   - Overview of NLP, historical perspective, common tasks.
2. **Text Preprocessing and Word Embeddings**  
   - Text normalization, tokenization, TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
3. **Text Classification**  
   - Techniques like Naive Bayes, SVMs, and neural networks for text classification.
4. **Language Modeling, RNNs, and LSTM**  
   - Understanding sequential models, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and LSTM.
5. **Self-Attention and Transformer Architecture**  
   - Detailed look into Transformers, attention mechanisms.
6. **BERT and Sesame Street Models**  
   - Pre-trained models like BERT, ELMo, and RoBERTa.
7. **GPT and Language Generation**  
   - GPT architecture, autoregressive models, language generation.
8. **Optimizing Large Language Models**  
   - Strategies for optimizing LLMs.
9. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Fine-Tuning**  
   - Fine-tuning LLMs with techniques like PEFT.
10. **LLM Alignment**  
    - Techniques to align large language models.
11. **Chatbots and Dialogue Systems**  
    - Building conversational agents, understanding intents, context management.
12. **Summarization and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
    - Techniques for text summarization, NER models.
13. **NLP and Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
    - Integration of RL with NLP tasks.
14. **Multimodal Models**  
    - NLP beyond textâ€”combining with other modalities like vision, speech.
